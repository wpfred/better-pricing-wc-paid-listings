# Better Pricing for WC Paid Listings
Boost your sales by building a custom pricing page and skip the not so pretty "Choose a Package" screen provided by WC Paid Listings.

## What does the plugin do?
It creates a shortcode [job_package_button] which you can add to your custom pricing page or on any other page or post on your site. You can use the shortcode parameter "id" to specify which product ID you is . It then redirects your customer directly to the job submission form skipping the "Choose a Package" screen provided by WC Paid Listings.  

## Why is this plugin helpful?
WC Paid Listings is a great little plugin that adds a custom "Job Product" to WooCommerce and helps you and your customers manage their job packages easily. But it comes with a very limited frontend pricing template called "Choose a Package". There are no styling options and you cannot change the order of the products (default is order by product_id which does not make any sense). Every E-Commerce business needs a beautiful pricing page where all your products, features and prices are displayed and that makes your customers actually WANT to buy your product. You can do that now with this simple plugin.

## What other plugins are required for this plugin to work?
This plugin adds functionality to the paid plugin WC Paid Listings which can only be used together with WP Job Manager and WooCommerce.

## How do I create my own pricing page for WC Paid Listings?
You can insert this shortcode on any post or page created on your site. There are plenty of pricing templates out there for Gutenberg, Elementor or just simply HTML templates which you can use to create your personal pricing page.
